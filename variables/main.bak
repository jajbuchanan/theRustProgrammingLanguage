fn main() {
    // let x = 5;  // Rust variables are not mutable by default, meaning that this would throw an
    // error; the x = 6 later on cannot change the immutable value
    let mut x = 5; // This works because mut makes the variable mutable
    println!("The value of x is: {x}"); 
    x = 6; 
    println!("The value of x is: {x}"); 
    // Ultimately it is up to you to determine if mutability should be used in a given situation
